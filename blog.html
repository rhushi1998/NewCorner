        <h6>1. what are the differences between arrow function and regular function?</h6>
        <p> <b><i>Anser:</i></b> </span>Arrow function can be written in less line of code
            compared to regular function. If one argument is passed, parentheses are not required. And also Curly
            brackets are not required if only one expression is present. Arrow function does not have argument
            bindings. Arrow functions doesnot support this keyword. Arrow functions must be excluded of duplicate
            named parameters whether we can use duplicate named parameters for regular function.</p>

        <h6>2. what are the differences between map, foreach, filter, find?</h6>
        <p> <b><i>Anser: </i></b> Map() methods are used for creating a new array from
            an existing one, reflecting a condition to each one of the elements of the first array. Like map()
            methods, forEach() methods iterates the element of an array, but it doesnot return a new array.
            <br>
            filter()
            methods
            are used to take each element of an array and returns the value from that array only which elements
            fullfill the conditions. On the other hand, find() method iterates the elements of an array and only
            return the first element which completes the condition.
        </p>

        <h6>3. what are the usage of template literals?</h6>
        <p><b> <i>Anser:</i></b> Using template literal we can easily use multiline
            text what was quite tough before template literals. Other than that, it also supports quote inside the
            strings very easily. After template literals, string interpolation has become quite easy and readable
            also. Most powerfull part is, in HTML templates, we can use template string which is often used in DOM
            manipulation. Template literals allow expressions in strings also.</p>
